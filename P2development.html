<h1>Development</h1>
<h4>Project 2</h4>

<h2>1. Display the hangman depending on the lives</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Using character that I found on the keyboard, I made a simple hangman character, for when the player has 0 lives left, and to make the other steps for when the player has more lives, I will take away one body part at a time.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>This is what it looks like in the game and from looking at it, I think that is would be good, for a child friendly hangman game, because it can be recognised as hangman, without being to realistic.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p2>Do you think that the hangman looks good for a child friendly hangman game? why?</p2>

<p>"Yes, I think that the hangman looks good for a child friendly hangman game. This is because it doesn't actually look like a person but it's still recognisable."</p>
<p>"Yes, because it's simple, and easy to look at."</p>

<p2>Do you think that their is anything that can be improved upon?</p2>

<p>"No, I think that it is good as it is."</p>
<p>"I think that its ok."</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<p>I decided to not change the hangman, because I think that it looks very good, but not to realistic so that children wouldnt get scared.</p>

<h2>2. Replay system</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Using while, I created a loop, so that people who want to play again can do so, and for people who dont want to play again, It will say good bye to them.</p>
