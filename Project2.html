<h2>
    Overview
</h2>
<p>
    In this page you will be shown how I used HTML to create a hangman game, with a functioning visual hangman, with 10 chances to guess a random 5 letter word, if the player guesses a letter wrong the letter will go into the already used letters group, and the player will lose 1 chance. If the player guesses correctly the letter that the player guesses will go into the already used group and the letter will go into the spot where it's supposed to be in blank spaces, that represents the 5 letter word.
</p>
<p>
    The player loses if they lose all 10 of their chances and make the full hangman, and the player wins if they guess all the letters in the 5 letter word, without losing all 10 of their chances.
</p>
<h2>
    End user
</h2>
<p>
    My end users are children aged from 8-12 years old, who speak english, and who are looking for a way to waste time, learn how to spell, and have some fun doing it. I think that children will like my hangman game, because it is a fun learning experience, for children interested in learning how to spell. I have taken a more child friendly approach to making my game, because I made a visual hangman out of letters, so that the children will be entertained for longer. The outcome of the hangman game is not to make it too complex so that children can understand how to play and have fun. My hangman game could be used to entertain children if the parent wants a break and just wants to relax.</p>
<h2>
    Requirements
</h2>
<h3>Visual Hangman</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add one line to the hangman every time the player guesses a wrong letter.</li>
    <li>Use computer symbols to visually display the hangman.</li>
    <li>When the hangman is fully complete, display the loose end message, and end the game.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Used letters</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Display the letters that have been used, both the correct and incorrect letters.</li>
    <li>If the player guesses a letter that has already been used, tell the player and make them guess again.</li>
    <li>Make the guessed letters separate from the 5 letter word so people donâ€™t get confused.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>5 letter word</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make 5 blank spaces for the letters that have not been guessed yet.</li>
    <li>When the player guesses a letter correctly, put it in the correct space that its supposed to be.</li>
    <li>When the player guesses all 5 letters correctly, display the win end message, and end the game.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>
    Implications
</h2>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>
    Clearly label each section of the screen, for the hangman, correct letters and guessed letters.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure to use easy to read words, for the end users and are going to be playing my game, and so that it's easy to understand.
</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>
    The hangman drawing works and displays the correct step according to how many chances the player has lost.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure that when the player guesses a letter incorrectly, that a chance is taken away from the initial, 10 chances.
</p>
<h3>Future Proofing</h3>
<p>
    Make sure to structure the code into sections, such as Lists, Main code, Functions, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure to use comments so that I know what code is used for each function of the game so that I know what to fix if anything goes wrong with the code, or  if I ever come back and look at it again.
