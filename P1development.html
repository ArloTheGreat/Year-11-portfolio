<h1>Development</h1>
<h4>Low Poly Character</h4>

<h2>1. Turnaround</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Using a piece of paper with lines to measure how tall my character should be, I drew the front and side view of my character, trying to design it after a medieval knight.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<h3>Test A</h3>
<p>I From looking at my drawing, I can see that I need to make the outline stand out much more, so that they are visible when I scan it.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p2>Do you think my character has correct proportions.</p2>

<p>"Yes, it has good proportions."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>

<p2>Do you think that my character resembles a knight.</p2>

<p>"Kind of."</p>
<p>"Not really."</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<p> I went over the outline that I already had and made them stand out more, and added more detail to the armor, so that it looked more like a knight.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<h3>Test A</h3>
<p>I am happy with how my head turned out</p>

<h3>2. Feedback</h3>

<p2>Do you think that the head looks good.</p2>

<p>"Yes, the head looks good."</p>
<p>"It looks good.."</p>

<p2>Do you think that my character resembles a knight helmet.</p2>

<p>"It could be a bit smaller."</p>
<p>"Yes it resembles a knight helmet."</p>

<h3>2. Improvements</h3>

<p> I just kept the helmet the same because I thought it came out good the first time.</p>
